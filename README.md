This code demonstrates the covariance algorithm introduced in the manuscript main text.

Please run the demo "QMC_coincidence_demo.m" using Matlab. 
The result is the QMC image of a USAF target.
The result is saved in the "Coincidence" file with both ".mat" and ".tif" forms.
The run time should be shorter than 5 seconds on a "normal" desktop computer.

Image data for Fig. 4 in the main manuscript is provided in the "Figures" file as
cell_center_X94_Y122.mat,
cell_center_X94_Y123.mat.
The (X94, Y122) and (X94, Y123) represent two different symmetric centers. Both the classical and quantum 
images are provided in each file.

All data used in this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.
